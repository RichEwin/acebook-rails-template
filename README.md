## Project Structure

- As a team we agreed to hold three daily stand-up meetings: 9am, 2pm, 5pm, which included a 2 mins per person round robin.
- We paired daily to complete allocated user stories. We switched pairs on a daily basis. At times, we used a technique called 'mobbing' to come together as a team if a pair was blocked. This worked amazingly well on every occasion!
- We recorded the ongoing status of each user story using a [Trello Borad](https://trello.com/b/vPCTtQTU/jjer-acebook-team-project). This helped when allocating work and identifying each pair's workload.
- We each contributed to a workdoc daily that allowed each member of the team to input ideas, basic pseudocode to attack a problem, and collaborate on project strategy.
